# Student sorting application

Frameworkless application for sorting and displaying student data. Decided to go frameworkless due to unneccessary complexity and boilerplate brought by major UI frameworks.
Structure is pretty simple. Everything that is needed for display of data is within `sorter.html` file. Sorting methods can be added by slightly tweaking html file and adding and import to it, which references file containing newly-implemented sort.
To run it - simply open in your browser. For testing purposes, `students.csv` file can be used.
